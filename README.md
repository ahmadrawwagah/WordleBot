# WordleBot
Python program that cheats in Wordle because I am not good enough at it.


Uses Selenium to scrap the Wordle game page.
Program guesses a predetermined start word and then takes in information on letters that are correct, present, or absent.
Uses that information to narrow down a wordbank and eventually find the answer.
